Setup: After a player places an obstacle, they must place a second obstacle touching that obstacle.

Nebula
Obstacles: 5 Gas Clouds, 3 Non-Asteroid Obstacles

Setup: After the second obstacle is placed, any additional obstacles must be placed within range 1-2 of another obstacle and beyond range 3 of the player board edges. Obstacles may be placed at range 2 of the neutral board edges.

Old Wreckage
Obstacles: 3 Asteroids, 5 Debris Clouds

Setup: Asteroids must be placed first. All asteroids after the first one must be placed within range 1-2 of other Asteroids. Debris Clouds must be placed touching an Asteroid and may be placed at range 1 of other Debris Clouds. They may be placed at range 2 of the neutral board edges.

Planetary Ring
Obstacles: 8 Obstacles

Scenarios:
Black Box
Setup: 4 Objective Tokens
After obstacles are placed, each player places 2 objective tokens within range 2 of their player board edge and and beyond range 3 of another objective token.

End Phase: Ships within range 1 of an opponent's objective token remove the objective token unless there is an enemy ship within range 1 of that token.

Scoring: After calculating scores, each player gains 30 points for each objective token claimed.
Emplacements
Setup: 4 Objective Tokens, 4 matching Objective Cards
After placing obstacles,starting with the second player, each player places 2 objective tokens representing defensive batteries. Defensive batteries must be placed within range 3 of the controlling player's board edge and beyond range 2 of another defensive battery.

Combat: Defensive batteries cannot modify their attack dice. While defending, defensive batteries are always considered to be reinforced.

Scoring: After calculating scores, each player gains 30 points for each defensive battery they destroyed.
---
Defensive Batteries: Each objective token is considered as a remote that can be targeted by attacks. Defensive batteries attack at initiative 0 and can fire at any ship within range 2-3.
Defensive batteries have a hull value of 5, an agility of 0 and a primary weapon value of 3. When attacking, range boni are not applied.
Probing Problem
Setup: 4 Objective Tokens, 4 matching Objective Cards
Each player places 2 objective tokens representing probes within range 2 of their player board edge and beyond range 3 of another probe.

System Phase: Each probe recovers 1 shield. Probes relocate using speed 1 or 2 bank or straight templates.

Combat: At initiative 0, probes may choose a ship within range 0-1. That ship gains a strain token and rolls 1 attack die. On a hit result, it gains 1 stress token.
---
Probes: Each objective token is considered as a remote that can be targeted by primary weapon attacks after round 3. When a player destroys a probe, that player gains 30 points.
Probes have a hull value of 4, an agility value of 2 and a shield value of 1.

VIP
Setup: 3 Pairs of Objective Cards
After placing forces, each player assigns each of their 3 objective cards (Lightsaber, Droid, Blaster) face-down to one or more of their ships. Assign the associated objective
tokens face-down to those ships as a reminder.
The Lightsaber token must be assigned, its carrier may not be placed in reserves.

After a ship with an objective token is damaged, reveal its objective card. If the Lightsaber objective card is revealed, place 2 evade tokens on it. While the ship with the Lightsaber objective card attacks or defends, it may remove up to two evade tokens from that card to gain that many matching tokens.

Scoring: If the ship equipped with the Lightsaber objective card is destroyed, the opposing player gains 50 points.



Wild Cards
Tritianiam Deposits
The range of detonating bombs is increased by 1.
Emergency Reinforcements
Setup: Before placing forces, each player chooses 1 small or medium ship and places it in reserve.

After a friendly ship was dealt a damage card, you may place a ship from your reserve within range 1 of any board edge and beyond range 3 of any enemy ship.
Outpost
Setup: After placing obstacles, each player places 1 outpost token at range 0 of an obstacle. Obstacles may have 1 or fewer outpost tokens at range 0.

Combat: While a ship defends, if it is within range 1 of an obstacle with an outpost token, that ship may change a focus result to an evade result.
Fractured Sensors
When a ship locks, it cannot acquire locks on ships obstructed by obstacles.

When a ship moves through or overlaps a gas cloud, it must break all of its locks and all locks on it.

Unstable Fuel
After a ship is destroyed, each ship at range 0â€“1 rolls 1 attack die. On a hit result, the ship suffers one regular damage.

When a bomb detonates, consider its maximum range as 1 range higher.
